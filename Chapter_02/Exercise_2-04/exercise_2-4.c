/*
 * Write a program that prompts for the userâ€™s weekly pay in dollars and the hours worked to be entered through the
 * keyboard as floating-point values. The program should then calculate and output the average pay per hour in the
 * following form:
 * Your average hourly pay rate is 7 dollars and 54 cents.
