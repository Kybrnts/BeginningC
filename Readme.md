# BeginningC

Study guide for Ivor Horton's Beginning C 4th edition book.
This includes some Mind Maps for each book chapter's content and also solutions for the proposed exercises.

Please use this information with caution as it might be outdated or even wrong as I am not an expert on the subject,
just and enthusiast. Hopefully this may help someone else while learning.

NOTICE: The code available in the "*.c" files may differ a bit from book's guidelines because it was also meant to be
	compiled on a Linux system as well as "Ansi C89" complaint, hence compiled with below command line:
     
	# gcc -xc -std=c89 -Wall -pedantic-errors -o program program.c
